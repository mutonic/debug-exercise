# Hide-and-Seek Bug Fixing Exercise
This exercise is part of the curriculum and aims to improve your debugging skills by locating and fixing hidden bugs in your learning partner's code. You will work in pairs or groups of three, where each person will prepare a repository with hidden bugs for others to discover.

## Learning Objectives
Locate a bug using manual QA methods.
Understand the importance of thoughtful, intentional problem-solving.
Identify how developer tools are used in debugging front-end code.

## Estimated Time
1 hour

## Exercise Instructions
Please read all the instructions before starting the exercise.

## Prepare Bugs:
Each person should prepare a repository with some hidden bugs to be discovered.
Spend up to 30 minutes creating the bugs in the repository.
You can reuse your portfolio repository and introduce bugs specifically in the JavaScript code.
Bug Fixing Process:
Clone your learning partner's repository. If you are in a group of three, make sure that everybody debugs someone else's code.
Open the project in the browser and utilize developer tools to debug the code.
Locally fix the identified bugs, but do not push any changes to the repository.
Once you have identified and understood the bugs, open an issue in the repository describing the bug and suggesting a possible solution.
Outcome Submission:
Submit the link to the created issue as the outcome of this exercise.
By participating in this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in locating and fixing bugs, as well as learning the importance of thoughtful problem-solving and utilizing developer tools effectively.

Happy bug hunting and happy debugging!
